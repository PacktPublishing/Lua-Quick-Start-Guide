**The easiest way to learn Lua programming**

## What is this book about?
Lua is a small, powerful and extendable scripting/programming language that can be used for learning to program, and writing games and applications, or as an embedded scripting language. There are many popular commercial projects that allow you to modify or extend them through Lua scripting, and this book will get you ready for that. This book is the easiest way to learn Lua. It introduces you to the basics of Lua and helps you to understand the problems it solves. You will work with the basic language features, the libraries Lua provides, and powerful topics such as object-oriented programming. Every aspect of programming in Lua, variables, data types, functions, tables, arrays and objects, is covered in sufficient detail for you to get started. You will also find out about Lua's module system and how to interface with the operating system.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand the basics of programming the Lua language 
* Understand how to use tables, the data structure that makes Lua so powerful 
* Understand object-oriented programming in Lua using metatables 
* Understand standard LUA libraries for math, file io, and more 
* Manipulate string data using Lua
